"""
Bearer-token verification for BigCommerce webhooks.

V58.36 P0 (2026-05-28): the previous HMAC-content-hash scheme
expected a header (X-BC-Api-Content-Hash) that BigCommerce does NOT
emit on outbound webhook deliveries — every order/product/uninstall
webhook silently 401'd at this middleware. Conversion tracking,
product sync, and uninstall teardown were ALL dead end-to-end.

BC's actual outbound-webhook auth model is the `headers` dict
configured at webhook registration time. The app generates a strong
secret, stores it in BIGCOMMERCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, propagates it as
`Authorization: Bearer <secret>` on register_all_webhooks, and this
middleware compares constant-time.

The function name `verify_webhook_hmac` is retained as a thin
backward-compat alias so existing call sites keep working; semantics
are now bearer-token comparison.
